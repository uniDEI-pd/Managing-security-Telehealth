HW6 - Managing security for Telehealth systems

## Pre-requisites
Nothing, just donwload and run index.html
 
## How-to
1) Only the doctor can create/update/delete new patients, once authenticated. Patients can only have access to their personal page.
2) Before updating/deleting a patient, you have to first search that patient with the "Read" button. Once the patient is successfully loaded it is possible to update his/her data or delete him/her from the database.
3) For testing the app:
   List of already registered doctors with passwords:
    - NAME: Derek Shepherd   PASSWORD: derek
    - NAME: Cristina Yang    PASSWORD: cristina
   For the patients you can find the complete list of registered patients in the doctor's page. To authenticate, put the name in the     correct field and the first name without capital letters as password (e.g. NAME: Michael Jordan   PASSWORD: michael).
